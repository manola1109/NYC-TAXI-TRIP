# NYC-TAXI-TRIP
NYC-taxi-trip-duration-prediction-Project
In this assignment, we are providing you the NYC-trip duration dataset.

At some point or the other almost each one of us has used an Ola or Uber for taking a ride.

Ride hailing services are services that use online-enabled platforms to connect between passengers and local drivers using their personal vehicles. In most cases they are a comfortable method for door-to-door transport. Usually they are cheaper than using licensed taxicabs. Examples of ride hailing services include Uber and Lyft. To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems for such services, it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied. If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be ending their current ride, they would be better able to identify which driver to assign to each pickup request.

You can download the dataset from the link given below and build a predictive model using that.
